# Huffman Compression

A huffman coding compression library in Rust.

I need this for my Rust implementation of an Ultima Online game server but thought it would be fun to write it as a separate lib.

## To do
- Refactor tests
- Add tests for extracted modules
- Check performance and tweak
- Add docs
- Provide a streaming interface?
